      <p>I've always loved drawing.</p>
      <p>The colours and form of cartoons were always an escape hatch from reality growing up.</p>
      <p>When I realised that I could emmulate what I saw then the drawbridge to my imagination was opened.</p>
      <p>I have drawn these to make me smile... if they have done the same for you then the world is a happier place.</p>
